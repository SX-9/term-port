Hi, I'm Satria, a self-taught web developer from Indonesia. I've been coding since 2021 and have experience with Node.js, web development, and Linux. As a student, I love spending my free time coding and experimenting with new technologies. My interests include machine learning, low-level systems, and circuitry. I'm an introvert by nature and prefer to spend most of my time working on personal projects. Thanks for taking the time to learn a little more about me!\n
