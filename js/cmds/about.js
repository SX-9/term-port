Hey there, I'm Satria! I'm a self-taught web developer with a passion for coding and biking. I've been coding since 2021, with experience in Node.js, web development, and Linux. My interest in low-level systems, circuitry, and machine learning keeps me engaged and curious. I'm fluent in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and I enjoy learning new languages and frameworks. As an introverted student, I enjoy spending time improving my skills and working on personal projects. If you want to connect with another coding enthusiast, don't hesitate to reach out!\
